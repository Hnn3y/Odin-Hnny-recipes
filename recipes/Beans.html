    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <ul>
           <li>¾ pound bacon</li> 
<li>pound ground beef</li> 

<li>2 large onions, chopped</li>

<li>1 (18 ounce) bottle honey barbecue sauce</li>
<li>4 (15 ounce) cans pork and beans</li>

<li>1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained</li>

<li> (15 ounce) can lima beans, rinsed and drained</li>

<li>1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained</li>

<li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
 <li>3 tablespoons cider vinegar</li>
 <li>>1 tablespoon liquid smoke flavoring (Optional)</li>
 <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
 <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
<h3>HOW TO</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
    <li>Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool, and crumble.</li>
    <li>Place the ground beef and onions into a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir until the meat is no longer pink, breaking the meat apart as it cooks, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Transfer the beef and onion mixture into a large Dutch oven. Stir in the crumbled bacon, honey barbecue sauce, pork and beans, kidney beans, lima beans, black beans, brown sugar, cider vinegar, liquid smoke, salt, and pepper.</li>
    <li>Cover, and bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 1 hour.</li>
<ul><li>>Mix all of the ingredients and cook on low heat for 4 to 6 hours.</li></ul>
